Troubleshoot.sh Workshop
=================

Source code for a workshop presented at DevOps Days Chicago 2022.

This content is very much a standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants presentation. 
Special thanks to @jdewinne for code and content contributions that made this track what it is today, and to all the troubleshoot.sh contributors who have helped to bring the project into the world.
